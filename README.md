# **Pokédex Web Application**
This repository is a project from my JavaScript course (March 2024) and contains a simple, interactive Pokédex web application built using HTML, CSS, and of course, JavaScript. The project fetches data from the Pokémon API to display a collection of Pokémon with details like images, stats, and evolutions.

## **Features**
- **Main Page:** Browse Pokémon with dynamically loaded cards.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for Pokémon by their ID.
- **See More Button:** Load additional Pokémon dynamically.
- **Details Page:** View detailed information for a specific Pokémon, including evolution data, moves, height, and weight.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across devices with a user-friendly layout.
## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML & CSS:** For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript:** To handle API calls and dynamic content loading.
- **Pokémon API:** For fetching real-time Pokémon data.
